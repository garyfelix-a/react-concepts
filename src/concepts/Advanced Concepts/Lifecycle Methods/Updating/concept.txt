methods in Updating lifecycle

->static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
    - same as in the mounting phase
->shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
    - determines if the component should re-rendered
    - used for performance optimization
    - E.g., shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState){
                // Return true to update, false to skip
                return true;
            }
->render()
    - same as in the mounting phase
->getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
    - Called before the changes from the Virtual DOM are applied to the DOM.
    - used to capture some information from the DOM before it changes
    - E.g., getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
                // Capture information (like scroll position)
                return null;
            }
->componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
    - called after the component is updated
    - used for side effects that need to happen after the DOM is updated
    - E.g., componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot){
                //perform operations with updated DOM
            }
