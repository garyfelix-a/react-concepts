    - methods are called when the instance of the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
    - Has several methods, they are
        -> constructor (props) - this will get called whenever a new component is created
                               - this is used for initializing a state or binding the event handlers
                               - Do not cause side effects. (i.e., do not make HTTP requests in constructors)
                               - Eg., constructor(props) {
                                        super(props);
                                        this.state = { count: 0 };
                                      }
        -> static getDerivedStateFromProps (props, state) - called before the rendering
                                                          - used to update the state or set the state based on props
                                                          - rarely used lifecycle method
                                                          - Do not cause side effects. (i.e., do not make HTTP requests)
                                                          - E.g.,  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
                                                                        // Return an object to update state, or null to update nothing
                                                                        return null;
                                                                    }

        -> render() - it is the only required method in the class component
                    - return the JSX to be rendered in the DOM.
                    - read props & state and return JSX
                    - Do not change state or interact with DOM or make AJAX calls.
                    - E.g., render(){
                                return <div>{this.state.count}</div>
                            }

        -> componentDidMound() - called only once when the component is rendered 
                               - this method is executed when all the methods and child components are executed.
                               - used for side effects like data fetching, AJAX Calls, subscriptions, etc. 
                               - E.g., componentDidMound(){
                                            // Fetch Data, add event listeners, etc.  
                                       }
